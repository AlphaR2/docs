The pricing structure is as follow:



| Type                     | Fees in lamports | Type       |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- |----------- |
| Base fee                 | 10               | Protocol   |
| Delegation fee           | 10%              | Protocol   |

The Base fee is the costs computing costs of sending transactions, on a FCFS basis, in an Ephemeral Rollup session. 
The Delegation fee is the costs incurred when undelegating an account and is meant to cover the settlement cost.
The Node operator fee is priority fee that node operators can enforce if they decide to parallelize transactions.
