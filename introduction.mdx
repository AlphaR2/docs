---

MagicBlock is a powerful and versatile open-source engine designed for building onchain games on Solana/SVM. 
Whether you're developing fully onchain or integrating Solana into your existing game, MagicBlock gives you the tools to abstract away the complexity and focus on creating the best experience for your users. 
MagicBlock is MIT-licenced and maintained by MagicBlock Labs. 


### The Framework

Our tools are modular and can be used independently from each other. We are working towards a comprehensive framework, but here's the list of the available products you can use for your game

- [BOLT](https://docs.magicblock.gg/BOLT/Introduction/ecs) - onchain Entity Component System built on top of Anchor
- [Solana Unity SDK](https://docs.magicblock.gg/SolanaUnitySDK/contribution-guide) - Verified Unity SDK for Solana
- [Session Keys](https://docs.magicblock.gg/Onboarding/Session%20Keys/introduction) - ephemeral keys for autosign tx
- [SOAR](https://docs.magicblock.gg/Frameworks/SOAR) Solana Onchain Achievements and Rankings
