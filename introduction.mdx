Magicblock is a powerful and versatile open-source framework designed for building on-chain games on Solana/SVM. 
Whether you're developing a fully on-chain game or looking to integrate Solana into your existing game, Magicblock gives you the tools to abstract away a lot of complexity and let you focus on creating the best experiences for your users. 
Magicblock is MIT-licenced and maintained by Magicblock Labs.
