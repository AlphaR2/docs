Magicblock is a framework and infrastructure provider for on-chain games. We push the boundaries of Solana to enable an open ecosystem of games that run entirely on the blockchain and can persist forever. Someone calls them "Forever Games", others "Fully On-chain Games". Someone has even theorized about the emergence of Autonomous Worlds out of these experiences.

Whether you are building on-chain, fully on-chain or an Autonomous World, here you'll find the resources you need to get started.
