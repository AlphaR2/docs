Welcome to the Magicblock ecosystem.
We build state-of-the-art infrastructure to enable an open ecosystem of "Forever Games", games that run entirely on a blockchain and will persist forever. Someone call the Fully-on-chain games or Autonomous Worlds.
Here you can find all the resources you need to get started.
