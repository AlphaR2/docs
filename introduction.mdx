Magicblock is a framework and infrastructure provider for on-chain games. We push the boundaries of Solana to enable an open ecosystem of games that run entirely on the blockchain and can persist forever. Someone calls them "Forever Games", others fully on-chain games or Autonomous Worlds.

Whether you building an Autonomous World, fully on-chain or just exploring integrating Solana into your game, here you'll find some useful resources to get started.
