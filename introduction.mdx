## Introduction

Welcome to the Magicblock ecosystem! If you are interested in on-chaing gaming here you will find like-minded individual that wants to have fun and build cool games just like yourself. We focus on building state-of-the-art infrastructure to enable what we like to call "Forever Games". Also known as "Fully on-chain games" or "Autonomous World", Forever Games are simply experiences that live entirely on a blockchain (can't be shut off) and where players and other developers can collaborate in the creation of an infinitely extendible world.
