Welcome to the Magicblock ecosystem.
We are building state-of-the-art infrastructure to enable an open ecosystem of Forever Games, games that run entirely on a blockchain and can persist forever. Someone calls them Autonomous Worlds, other simply "fully-on-chain games". Regardless of how you call them, we are pretty excited about them. 
Here you can find all the resources you need to get started with your first on-chain game.
