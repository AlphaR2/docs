Session Keys are ephemeral keys with fine-grained instruction scoping for tiered access in your Solana Programs.

Session keys are a giant leap for improving UX for players as they take away the need for repeated wallet popups while a user performs actions in-game like purchases or on-chain interactions. The expiry and access are stored at the contract level which immunes session keys from potential security vulnerabilities. The Session Keys parameters can be duration, the maximum amount of tokens spent, amount of transactions or any other function specific to your use case.


You can also have a layered security model which allows tiered access to a session key making sure a user’s funds and assets are always secure and can’t be accessed by the session keys. 
This type of layered security is a standard model in web2 applications and provides a stronger defence against attacks and helps ensure the security of your users' asset.


#### What are some use cases?

There are so many use cases that Session Keys unlock.
