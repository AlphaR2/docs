## Rust
[Install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) Rust.

## Solana
[Install](https://docs.solanalabs.com/cli/install) Solana and then run ```bash solana-keygen``` new to create a keypair at the default location. Anchor uses this keypair to run your program tests.

## Yarn
[Install](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) Yarn.

## BOLT
BOLT is built on top of Anchor, therefore having a general knowledge of Anchor will give you the necessary tool to build the game logic. We recommend reading chapters 1-4 of the [Anchor book](https://book.anchor-lang.com/introduction/what_is_anchor.html)

Install BOLT

```bash
npm install -g @magicblock-labs/bolt-cli
```
or
```bash
yarn global add @magicblock-labs/bolt-cli
```

Verify the installation

```bash
bolt -h
