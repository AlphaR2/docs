## BOLT Engine

Bolt is a high-performance, scalable SVM-based framework designed for Fully On Chain (FOC) Games and Autonomous Worlds.

With Bolt, you can create games that live forever on the blockchain. These games are platform-centric by default, empowering users to extend and modify both game content and logic. Bolt facilitates multiplayer gaming experiences with performances on pair with traditional multiplayer servers.

Furthermore, the framework incorporates an Entity Component System (ECS) architecture, streamlining the game structuring and assembly process and providing ready-to-use components. Developers can reuse and contribute modules and logic deployed on the blockchain.

All these features collectively reduce the intricacy of crafting fully on-chain games, enabling developers to focus more on the game's essence.
