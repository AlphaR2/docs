## BOLT Engine

BOLT is a high-performance, composable SVM-based framework designed for Fully Onchain Games (FOC) and Autonomous Worlds (AW)

With BOLT, you can create games that live forever on the blockchain. These games are platform-centric by default, empowering users to extend and modify both game content and logic. BOLT facilitates multiplayer gaming experiences with performances on par with traditional multiplayer servers ([whitepaper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02650))

The framework incorporates an Entity Component System (ECS) architecture, streamlining the game structuring and assembly process and providing ready-to-use onchain components. Developers can reuse and contribute with modules and logic deployed on the blockchain.

BOLT reduces the complexity of building fully onchain games, allowing developers to focus on the core gameplay rather than underlying blochchain layer.
