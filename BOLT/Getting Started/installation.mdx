## Rust
[Install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) Rust.

## Solana
[Install](https://docs.solanalabs.com/cli/install) Solana and then run ```bash solana-keygen``` new to create a keypair at the default location. Anchor uses this keypair to run your program tests.

## Yarn
[Install](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) Yarn.

## Bolt
Bolt is built on top of Anchor, therefore having a general knowledge of Anchor will give you the necessary tool to build the game logic. We recommend reading chapters 1-4 of the Anchor book

Install Bolt using Cargo.

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/magicblock-labs/bolt  --locked --force
```
On Linux systems you may need to install additional dependencies if cargo install fails. E.g. on Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get install -y pkg-config build-essential libudev-dev
```
Verify the installation
```bash
bolt -h
```
