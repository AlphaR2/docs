description: 'Why you should be building fully on-chain games'
---

Forever Games or "Fully on-chain" games refers to the idea of having both the state and the logic of a game built entirely on a blockchain. There are several reasons why this can make sense. First, you don't need a server. The blockchain is your server and any application running on top of it can inherit its persistency. Second, it promotes more user-generated content (UGC) and user-generated logic (UGL). If the logic is executed by smart contracts that automate the enforcement of rules and the execution of actions within the game, whoever deploys a new smart contract can alter the mechanics of that game in a transparent, persistent and permissionless fashion. New dynamics, unforeseen by the original developer, can emerge. In short, users not only play the game but becomes active demiurge of that world. 
Ultimately, the premise of fully on-chain games is to unlock the next level of autonomy and creativity, allowing players and developers to collaborate in the creation of infinitely extendible worlds.
