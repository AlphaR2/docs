## Setting up Session Keys

In order to use session keys in dApps, you need to have the program properly set up for validation and usage. This will ensure the program receives the token, validates it against the existing setup, and allows for signing. To know more about this, check the core concepts.

## Integration Steps Overview

Session Keys require implementation on both the Solana Program and client-side application. The integration follows a two-step process:

### Step 1: Program Integration

The Solana program needs to validate session tokens and enforce permissions at the program level. This ensures that session keys can only perform the actions they're authorized for. This is achieved by introducing the session macro attribute in the instruction struct which derives the Session trait and adding the session macro that validates the session.

### Step 2: Client Integration

The dApp creates and manages session keys, providing users with a seamless experience. Once a session is established, users can perform authorized actions without wallet popups, with the ability to revoke the session token.
