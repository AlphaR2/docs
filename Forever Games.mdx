Forever Games or "Fully on-chain" games refer to the idea of building both the state and logic of a game entirely on a blockchain. The are different reason why this can be advantageous.


**Persistency** - To begin with, you won't have to deal with a server. The blockchain is your server and any application running on top of it will inherits its persistency and censorship-resistance properties. Provided the blockchain is actually decentralized and nodes have the economic incentive to keep adding blocks, you can build games that run forever. 

**UGC/UGL** - Second, on-chain games encourage more user-generated content (UGC) and user-generated logic (UGL). Due to provable ownership and verifiable traceability, it's very easy for creators to be entitled royalties, revenue-share or microtransactions for the contente they add to your game. If the logic is executed by smart contracts that automate the enforcement of rules or the execution of actions within the game, then anyone who deploys a new smart contract can transparently and permissionlessly alter the mechanics of that game, leading to the emergence of new dynamics that the original developer may not have foreseen. Users become an active demiurge of that world, they are not only playing that game but actively shaping it.

**Crypto-primitives** - Your game is natively plugged in a rich system of protocols, dapps, smart contracts that you can freely and permiossionlessly utilise to enrich your players experience. Defi for in-game economies, identity systems, governance tools... The list goes on and on. You can integrated with most of these primitives even with a traditional client-server architecture, but the advantage of being already on-chain is precisely that you don't need any integration, they are already available by default. We think we might even seen the emergence of new game-specific primitives (i.e. a novel governance layer for managing in-game resources across guilds/rival factions).

Ultimately, we think on-chain games will unlock the next level of autonomy and creativity in gaming, allowing players and game developers to collaborate in the creation of infinitely extendible and customizable game experiences. 

## What about other games?

Many Web3 games (in fact most of them) will only integrate limited aspects of the game expericence on-chain. This is OK! 
Building fully on-chain games can be challenging (although we do our best to do the heavy-lifting for you) and it ultimately boils down to the players' preferences. Check out all the categories of games that are built with on our Ecosystem with our infrastructure.
