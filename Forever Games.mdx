Unstoppable Games or fully onchain games are games whose state and logic run entirely on a blockchain. There are several reasons why building entirely onchain can be advantageous.

**Persistency** - To begin with, you won't have to deal with a server. The blockchain is your server and any application running on top of it will inherit its persistency and censorship-resistance properties. Provided the blockchain is actually decentralized and nodes have the economic incentive to keep adding blocks, you can build games that run \*forever.

**Permiossionless Composability** - Onchain games lower the barrier for User-Generated Content (UGC) and User-Generated Logic (UGL). It's very easy for creators receive royalties or microtransactions for the content they add to your game. When it comes to the logic, if it is executed by smart contracts that enforce rules and/or execute actions, anyone can transparently and permissionlessly alter the mechanics of that game, leading to the emergence of new dynamics that the original developer may not have foreseen. Users become an active demiurge of that world - they are not only playing the game but actively shaping it.

**Crypto-primitives** - Your game is natively plugged in a rich system of protocols, dapps, smart contracts that you can freely and permissionlessly acces to enrich your players experience. Defi primitives for in-game economies, identity systems, governance tools, the list goes on and on. You can integrate with most of these primitives even with a traditional client-server architecture, but the advantage of being already on-chain is precisely that you don't need any integration, they are already available by default. We think we might even see the emergence of new game-specific primitives (i.e. a novel governance layer for managing in-game resources across guilds/rival factions).

Ultimately, we think onchain games will unlock a new chapter of play, allowing players and game developers to collaborate in the creation of infinitely extendible and customizable digital experiences.
