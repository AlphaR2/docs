Forever Games or "Fully on-chain" games refer to the idea of building both the state and logic of a game entirely on a blockchain. For a game taxonomy check out this excellent [article](https://jumpcrypto.com/writing/defining-on-chain-gaming/) by Jump. 

The are different reasons why building your game fully on-chain can be advantageous.


**Persistency** - To begin with, you won't have to deal with a server. The blockchain is your server and any application running on top of it will inherits its persistency and censorship-resistance properties. Provided the blockchain is actually decentralized and nodes have the economic incentive to keep adding blocks, you can build games that run *forever. 

**UGC/UGL** - structurally, on-chain games lower the barrier for user-generated content (UGC) and user-generated logic (UGL). Due to provable ownership and verifiable traceability, it's very easy for creators to be paid with royalties, revenue-share or microtransactions for the content they add to your game. When it comes to the logic of your game, if it is exectued by smart contracts that enforce rules and/or execute set of actions, anyone who deploys a new smart contract can transparently and permissionlessly alter the mechanics of that game, leading to the emergence of new dynamics that the original developer may not have foreseen. Users become an active demiurge of that world - they are not only playing the game but actively shaping it.

**Crypto-primitives** - Your game is natively plugged in a rich system of protocols, dapps, smart contracts that you can freely and permiossionlessly utilise to enrich your players experience. Defi for in-game economies, identity systems, governance tools, the list goes on and on. You can integrated with most of these primitives even with a traditional client-server architecture, but the advantage of being already on-chain is precisely that you don't need any integration, they are already available by default. We think we might even seen the emergence of new game-specific primitives (i.e. a novel governance layer for managing in-game resources across guilds/rival factions).

Ultimately, we think on-chain games will unlock a new chapter of play, allowing players and game developers to collaborate in the creation of infinitely extendible and customizable game experiences. 

## What about other games?

Many Web3 games (in fact most of them) will only shift limited aspects of the game expericence on-chain. This is OK! 
Building fully on-chain games can be challenging (although we chewed most of the glass for you) and it ultimately boils down to the players' preferences. Check out all the games that are built on the our Ecosystem with our open-source infrastructure.
